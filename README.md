Join our Frontend Team
======================

Make a copy of the website design using React. Website desktop (Desktop.pdf) and mobile (Mobile.pdf) versions are available in Design folder. Design elements are available in Assets folder.

## Technology stack

You are expected to use the following:
- Javascript framework (React, Angular or VueJs framework);
- Library for state management (for example Redux, Vuex);
- SCSS syntax for page styles using SASS or LESS;
- ECMAScript 6 for JavaScript.

Bonus for the following:
- Unit tests;
- Lint usage in project
- Readme file

## Requirements

- The website must be compatible with: Firefox, Chrome, Edge browsers;
- Design must be responsive;
- The dropdown in the menu must be shown on mouse over;
- The main “Offers today” banner image must be taken dynamically and mapped using conditionCode from the [Meteo API](https://api.meteo.lt) (if you would decide to go with this api - you will face CORS errors. [This](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/#documentation) should help you). Banner images and other design elements are provided in the Assets folder.
- The links in header must be active - and each one of those must go to a single static content page (which consists of header, footer and the generated content - lorem ipsum):
- There must be a button go back;
- The router must be a SPA router (for example [react router](https://reactrouter.com) or [vue router](https://router.vuejs.org))
- The urls that user browsed to must be stored in state (don’t use the native browsers ability to go back).

## How we review

The submitted code will be evaluated for the following aspects:
-  **Design**. How is the design implemented, is there any differences in how we see it? Do you use mobile first design pattern?
-  **Compatibility**. Does the design look more or less the same in all of the browsers? Is it responsive on all the screen sizes? Does the application look good on mobile?
-  **Architecture**. How are the files structured? Does the file names match the contents of it?
-  **Code Quality**. Does the code run without errors? Do you handle errors? How well HTML semantics are used? How is the CSS/Javascript implemented? Do you make separate commits for different features?

## Code submission

Project should use a free github private repository and share it with “joinAdeoWeb”.
